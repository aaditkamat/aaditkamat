# Aadit Kamat (he/him/his)

## Brief Intro
After gaining industry experience, I realized that I want to have an impactful career. Though the tech industry offers such opportunities, I seek roles and organizations whose missions align with helping others. 

This is how I stumbled upon Effective Altruism and realized that a career in an EA organization fits the bill of a "dream career". 

As a former engineer, I decided to switch gears and pursue a Data Science concentration through the MSISOM program at Hough College, in order to enhance my proficiency and eventually pursue a career in EA.

## Fun fact
My first name means **Peak** or **Sun God**
