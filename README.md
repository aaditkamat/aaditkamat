### Brief Intro
I recently graduated from the [MSISOM (Master's in Information Systems and Operations Systems) program](https://warrington.ufl.edu/master-of-science-in-information-systems-and-operations-management/) offered by the Warrington College of Business at the University of Florida. 

Before joining this Master's program, I worked as a **Quality Assurance Engineer at [Shopee](https://shopee.sg), the leading e-commerce firm within Southeast Asia (SEA) and Taiwan** and a **Software Engineer at the [Visa Singapore Office](https://www.visa.com.sg/)**. As a QA Engineer at Shopee, I was responsible for [**designing and executing automated test cases for the Android app**](https://dev.to/banglatechtalk/003-software-testing-rakib-amin-senior-engineer-shopee) with our in-house testing framework to enhance the user experience. At Visa, I **developed payment APIs with Spring Boot** and **designed the front end for an Admin portal used by [Innovation Centre](https://www.visa.co.uk/visa-everywhere/innovation-centers/singapore.html) teams in APAC and EMEA with Next.js**.

My academic journey has been an exciting pivot from my previous engineering roles. Throughout this program, I have acquired skills in **statistical analysis**, advanced Excel for **quantitative analysis**, **modeling business requirements** using tools such as ER diagrams, and **implementing them using SQL databases**.

Last summer, I had the opportunity to intern as a Data Analyst at Getzler Henrich & Associates LLC, where I learnt how senior analysts in the firm create **bespoke** 13-week cash flow models for **middle-market firms** under financial distress, assisting them in **improving their economic outcomes**.

I have also consulted for different non profit organizations in Jacksonville such as [WeCareJax](https://wecarejacksonville.org/) and [Jacksonville Electric Authority (JEA)](https://www.jea.com/) as a core member of the [AIS Consulting Committee](https://www.ufais.org/consulting). To gain practical business analytics experience, I have also completed a Business Analytics Practicuum project for [Revenue Management Solutions](https://www.revenuemanage.com/) focusing on **gleaning insights from the financial data of restaurants** using [metiRi](https://www.revenuemanage.com/solution/metiri/) and **comparing methods like [Data Envelopment Analysis](https://rpubs.com/Cagri/DEA) for benchmarking financial performance across decision-making units**. 

I enjoy learning new things, collaborating with others, and growing together.
